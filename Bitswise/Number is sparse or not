*********************IF NO HAS CONSECUTIVE 1 OR NOT(SPARSE)***********
Given a number N. The task is to check whether it is sparse or not. A number is said to be a sparse number if no two or more consecutive bits are set in the binary representation.

Example 1:

Input: N = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Binary Representation of 2 is 10, 
which is not having consecutive set bits. 
So, it is sparse number.
Example 2:

Input: N = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Binary Representation of 3 is 11, 
which is having consecutive set bits in it. 
So, it is not a sparse number.
