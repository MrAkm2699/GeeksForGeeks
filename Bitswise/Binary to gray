***********gray code is*******
Binary to Gray conversion : 
The Most Significant Bit (MSB) of the gray code is always equal to the MSB of the given binary code.
Other bits of the output gray code can be obtained by XORing binary code bit at that index and previous index.

Example 1:

Input: N = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: 7 is represented as 111 in 
binary form. The gray code of 111 is 100, 
in the binary form whose decimal equivalent 
is 4.
Example 2:

Input: N = 10
Output: 15
Explanation: 10 is represented as 1010 in 
binary form. The gray code of 1010 is 1111, 
in the binary form whose decimal equivalent 
is 15.

int greyConverter(int n)
    {
        
        return (n^n>>1);
        
    }
