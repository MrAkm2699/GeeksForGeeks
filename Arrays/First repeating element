/*
Given an array arr[] of size N, find the first repeating element. The element should occurs more than once and the index of its first occurrence should be the smallest.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Output: 2
Explanation: 
5 is appearing twice and 
its first appearence is at index 2 
which is less than 3 whose first 
occuring index is 3.
